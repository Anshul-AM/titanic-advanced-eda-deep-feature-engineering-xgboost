# Titanic Advanced EDA, Deep Feature Engineering, and XGBoost

This project conducts an in-depth analysis of the Titanic dataset, focusing on advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA), deep feature engineering, and the implementation of the XGBoost model to predict passenger survival. The goal of this project is to leverage data-driven techniques to enhance the prediction model by creating new features and optimizing performance.

## Methodology

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
We started with a comprehensive exploratory data analysis using visualization libraries such as:

- `seaborn (sns)`
- `plotly.express (px)`
- `matplotlib.pyplot (plt)`

The EDA focused on understanding passenger demographics, ticket information, and survival rates across various groups.

### Feature Engineering:
After the EDA, we performed deep feature engineering to improve model performance. Key steps included:

- Handling missing data.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Creating new features such as `FamilySize` and `IsAlone`.
- Binning ages and fares into relevant categories.

### Model Implementation:
We implemented the XGBoost model, known for its performance and efficiency in handling large datasets. The model was fine-tuned using hyperparameter optimization techniques to enhance predictive accuracy.

### Feature Importance:
We analyzed feature importance to identify the most significant predictors of survival. This analysis helped in refining the model by focusing on the most impactful features.

### Conclusion:
This notebook serves as a comprehensive example of using data science techniques to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. By conducting thorough EDA, creating new features, and optimizing the XGBoost model, we aim to provide a robust solution to this classic machine learning problem.
